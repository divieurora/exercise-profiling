## Reflections

1. The approach with JMeter is usually utilized to measuring metrics such as response time, latency, and others to evaluate overall system performance. On the other hand, IntelliJ Profiler is utilized to analyze deep down to specific function levels like excessive memory usage, high method execution times, or other issues within the application code.
2. Profiling process is valuable for identifying deep dwon through the application. Profilers record all the function calls and gather all the data so that all the information can be obtained including the CPU usage, memory allocation, garbage collections, and concurrency.
3. Yes, IntelliJ Profiler is highly effective to help analyzing application code. IntelliJ Profiler is letting us know which part of the code are consuming significant time. It allows us the developers to optimize that part of the code.
4. For me, it's the complexity of the system and the optimization part. Due to a large and complex systems, it could be difficult sometimes to understand what is happening when profiling is running. And optimization also hard to do because we have to think about another approach which is should be consuming lesser time than before.
5. The main benefits I gain from using IntelliJ Profiler is that the profiler is integrated with the IDE I am using, IntelliJ IDEA IDE, so I don't have to install other plugins. Besides that, IntelliJ Profiler provides a very detailed informations about the application's runtime behavior.
6. Maybe I would recheck all the configurations that may cause the inconsistency and run it all over again.
7. For most of the optimization, I applied algorithm optimization not changing the function of the code. And then, I measure the changes with JMeter and Profiler. Also, I should have make a test for all the optimization codes, but I don't do it yet.
